Overview:
===============================================================================

This package contains a Perl script and configuration files that let you
download the HEMCO data directories to your local disk space.  This is a
convenience routine.


Files:
===============================================================================

(1) README               : This file

(2) hemcoDataDownload.pl : Perl script to download HEMCO data directories

(3) hemcoDataDownload.rc : Configuration file for the hemcoDataDownload.pl
                           script.  In this file you can specify which
                           HEMCO data directories you would like to download
                           and which you would like to omit.

(4) forTesting.rc        : A configuration file that you can use for testing
                           or debugging.  This will tell hemcoDataDownload.pl
                           only to download a couple of emissions inventories
                           with files that do not take up much disk space.


Using the script to download HEMCO emissions data:
===============================================================================

To run the script you can type:

   hemcoDataDownload.pl  

which will read the default "hemcoDataDownload.rc" configuration file.   

You can also specify a different configuration file name as an argument
to the script.

For example, we have provided a configuration file named "forTesting.rc" 
that you can use to test if the data is being downloaded to the right 
directory path.  Typing:

   hemcoDataDownload.pl forTesting.pl

will only download a couple of data inventories that do not take up much disk
space.  This allows you to ensure that the data transfer is sucessful without
making you wait a long time.


Configuration files:
===============================================================================

The configuration files are pretty much self-explanatory.  

At the top of the file you will see this section:

 ##############################################################################
 #                                                                            #
 #  Specify the remote and local HEMCO data paths, plus other options.        #
 #                                                                            #
 ##############################################################################

 Remote HEMCO data path | ftp://ftp.as.harvard.edu/gcgrid/data/ExtData/HEMCO
 Your HEMCO data path   | /as/scratch/bmy/HEMCO
 Verbose output         | yes
 Dryrun only?           | no

(1) The "Remote HEMCO data path" is the location on the FTP server from which
    you are going to download the data.  This can be from either Harvard or
    from Dalhousie.  (For now we will use the Harvard server).  You can edit
    this accordingly.

(2) The"Your HEMCO data path" specifies the root-level directory for HEMCO
    data on your own disk space.  If you are not sure where to place this,
    then ask your sysadmin.

(3) The "Verbose output" flag lets you specify if you want to print out extra
    output during the download process.  This can be set to either "yes" or
    "no".

(4) The "Dryrun only" flag allows you to print out the data download commands
    without actually downloading the data.  This is useful for debugging.


In the next section you specify all of the HEMCO inventories that you want
to download.  You will see this header:

 ##############################################################################
 #                                                                            #
 #  THE FOLLOWING DATA DIRECTORIES WILL BE DOWNLOADED.                        #
 #                                                                            #
 #  These data directories comprise the recommended emissions configuration   #
 #  for typical GEOS-Chem full-chemistry and specialty simulations.           #
 #                                                                            #
 ##############################################################################
 
 #=============================+===============================================
 # AEROSOLS                    | Directory paths

 Secondary organic aerosols    | $ROOT/SOA/v2014-07
 
 ... etc...

Lines starting with the comment character # will be ignored.  Each line
specifies the name of a HEMCO emissions inventory and the data path where
it can be found on disk, relative to the root data path.

NOTE: The script will replace the $ROOT token with the value you gave to 
the "HEMCO remote data path" above.

Any inventory found in this section will be downloaded.  To prevent an 
inventory from being downloaded you can either comment it out (i.e. place a
# in the first column) or move the inventory to the next section.


The final section specifies HEMCO emission inventories that you do not wish
to download.  The section looks like this:

 ##############################################################################

 #  THE FOLLOWING DATA DIRECTORIES WILL NOT BE DOWNLOADED.                     #
 #                                                                             #
 #  These data directories contain are optional emissions inventories that     #
 #  are not used in typical GEOS-Chem simulations.  If you wish to download    #
 #  any of these inventories, simply move the corresponding entry for each     #
 #  inventory to the previous section.                                         #
 #                                                                             #
